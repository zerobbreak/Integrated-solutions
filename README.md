This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Website Design Ideas

1. **Homepage Design:**
   - Hero Section: A full-width image or animation of commuters on a bus, engaged with their devices. Prominent CTA button: "Get Connected" or "Advertise with Us."
   - Tagline displayed prominently.
   - Key Sections: "Our Vision," "Advertiser Benefits," "How It Works," and "Join the Network," with smooth scrolling effects.

2. **Content Layout:**
   - Advertisers Section: Explain WiFi marketing benefits with visuals like icons and case studies.
   - Commuters Section: Highlight benefits of fast, free WiFi with testimonials.
   - Bus Operators Section: Emphasize advantages for bus operators using infographics.
   - Footer: Clean and simple footer with links to legal information and contact details.

3. **Visual & Interactive Elements:**
   - Interactive Maps: Show coverage and expansion plans.
   - Data and Analytics: Display interactive graphs for customer insights.

4. **User-Friendly Design:**
   - Clear Navigation: Top navigation bar for easy access to important pages.
   - Fast Loading Times: Optimize for desktop and mobile for a high-quality service experience.

## Typography Suggestions

1. **Primary Font:** Roboto or Lato (Sans-serif) - Clean, modern, and readable for digital formats.
2. **Accent Font:** Raleway or Montserrat - Slightly more stylized for headlines and emphasis while maintaining professionalism.

These design concepts aim to create a sleek, modern, and professional image for Synconex, reflecting its core values of connectivity, synchronicity, and sustainability while providing a user-friendly experience for both commuters and advertisers.
